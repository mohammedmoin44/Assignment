# Binary Classification

 Exploratory analysis of the dataset  deciding on feature selection, preprocessing before training a model to classify as class ‘0’ or class ‘1’

## Roadmap

- Importing important libraries

- Analysing the content of the dataset
- Wheather it has some missing values are not
- Performing Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection
- Removing outliers if any using appropriate techinque
- Model selection and prediction


### Model performance Analysis

- Model performance is measured using below parameters and it was found to be
- accuracy :  0.93
- Precision :  0.93
- Recall :  0.93
- F1-score :  0.93

## Libraries Used
